# WooCommerce

Develop a custom WooCommerce product variation display feature for a clothing store website. The
website sells clothing items such as T-shirts, and each T-shirt has variations in size and color. The goal
is to enhance the product page to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly way to select product
variations.
